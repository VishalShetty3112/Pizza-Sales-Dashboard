# 📌 Problem Statement
Despite achieving solid overall revenue and sales volume, Pizza Land faces challenges in optimizing product performance, balancing category contributions, and addressing underperforming time periods and products. The business seeks to identify which pizzas, sizes, and time frames contribute most to profitability—and where improvements are needed to maximize growth and operational efficiency.

Key issues identified:

Inconsistent sales trends across months, with September showing the lowest performance.

Certain pizzas like The Brie Carre Pizza and the Chicken category are consistently underperforming in both revenue and orders.

XXL pizza size generates minimal revenue, indicating low demand or poor positioning.

Opportunity to better capitalize on top-selling pizzas and days to maximize ROI.

# ✅ Conclusion
* The Pizza Land Sales Analysis reveals that the company is performing well overall, with: Strong total revenue of $817.9K and 21.4K orders. Large pizzas and Classic category items emerging as top performers. Peak sales occurring on Fridays and during July and December, which can be further leveraged.
* However, challenges such as low-performing SKUs (like The Brie Carre Pizza) and sales dips in specific months (like September) suggest areas for improvement. By phasing out underperforming items, promoting best sellers, optimizing marketing efforts during slow months, and capitalizing on popular pizza sizes and categories, Pizza Land can enhance profitability, streamline its offerings, and drive sustained growth.


# 📈 Recommendations to Improve Performance
* Focus on Low-Performing Items
Promote or rework the Brie Carre Pizza – lowest in both revenue and sales. Investigate and possibly revise the Chicken category offering – least ordered. Consider bundling or discounts for XL and XXL pizzas to improve visibility and sales.
*  Capitalize on High-Performers
Upsell The Classic Deluxe and Thai Chicken Pizza with combo offers or meal deals. Feature these top sellers in marketing campaigns and homepage banners.
*  Boost Off-Peak Performance
Sunday and Monday see lower orders – introduce offers or discounts on these days. October & November are slower months – consider seasonal campaigns or limited-time offers.
* Product Strategy by Size
Since Large pizzas dominate revenue, ensure they're promoted heavily, re-evaluate pricing and packaging for XL/XXL pizzas, or remove them if they're not viable.
*  Improve Order Value
Current avg. pizzas/order is 2.32 – introduce “Buy 2, Get 1” or side-dish upsells to raise this issue, use loyalty programs to encourage repeat purchases and larger orders.
*  Deep Dive by Month/Day
Analyze why Q4 and months like October underperform despite festive seasons – maybe pricing or competition needs reassessment, invest in weekly promotions to keep traffic stable.
